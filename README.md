# Simple Website Built with React and Nextjs

**This is a simple website**, built as a test with Nextjs and React js. This is nothing more than an exercise and the project may contain many errors, it is my first time experimenting. The interface is based on the ProyectoZulgrana UI (sports page). It is something simple and very beautiful, it has a lot to improve and I will continue adding many more things. At the moment it may have errors since I have not been very careful in searching for them. It is also worth mentioning that it is a dynamic project where all the information is in .json files, this idea came from a dynamic video made by Midudev. I hope you like it, greetings. Don't forget to fork
